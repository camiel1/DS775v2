    "Adapt our \"homemade\" simulated annealing code from Section 2.1 in the lesson to solve the 48 capitals TSP problem from last week.  The json file `Caps48.json` in the data folder has both the distance matrix and the coordinates of the cities for plotting.  Note the distance of typical random tour is something like 80,000,000 meters and we're looking for something under 19,000,000 meters.  Your initial temperature has to be large enough to allow large moves on this scale and you'll have to increase `max_moves_no_improve` as well.  You should plot the progress of the search, like in the lesson, and you should plot the final result on the map of the United States as we did last week (that code is given in a cell below). Included a value for the random seed so that your results are reproducible.  Report a search that gives total distance < 18,000,000 meters.  A tour that achieves the optimum distance is shown in the json file.  "
